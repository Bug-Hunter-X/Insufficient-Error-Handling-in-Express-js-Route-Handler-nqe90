This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling within route handlers. The `bug.js` file shows a vulnerable route that does not properly handle database errors or invalid user inputs, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially expose sensitive information.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, showcases best practices for robust error handling, ensuring a more secure and user-friendly application.  The solution includes specific error handling for database errors, input validation, and the use of appropriate HTTP status codes to provide informative feedback to clients.
